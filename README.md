This repository contains c# projects that i made for practice and learn c# and DotNet

## A Brief History of C#
C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Anders Hejlsberg at Microsoft in the late 1990s. Released in 2002 as part of the .NET framework, it combined the power of C++ with a simpler, Java-like syntax.

Key milestones include:

- 2005 (C# 2.0): Generics and nullable types.
- 2007 (C# 3.0): LINQ and lambda expressions.
- 2012 (C# 5.0): Async/await for asynchronous programming.
- 2014: Became open source with .NET Core.
- 2020 (C# 9.0): Records and improved null safety.
C# remains a top choice for enterprise applications, game development (Unity), and web services, constantly evolving to meet modern development needs.
